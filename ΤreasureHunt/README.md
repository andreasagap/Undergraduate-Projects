# Treasure Hunt
Î¤his program was for "MULTIAGENT SYSTEMS" course.

The program contains graphics to make easier for the user to see the agents's locations. There are two teams ( each team has 2 agents). The goal is to find the treasure and the agents of the same team can communicate. There are many obstacles (lakes and sea) and the agents can evaluate the next movement. In addition, each agent keeps track of his previous moves.
### Elements of the environment:
* The treasure is yellow.
* The first team of agents is red.
* The second team of agents is white.
* The lakes are light blue.
* The sea is blue.
