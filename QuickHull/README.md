## Quickhull java implementantion.



This programme is about to choose the shortest path from a state to a marked destination . You have to pass a field full of landmines, and you can not go between them. You must pass around at a short distance.

### Example 


**input.txt**

```
4 62 <- Your position
125 95
156
5 63
124 100
23 108
50 99
108 107
52 54
115 107
102 86
100 83
103 500
91 73
95 79
43 57
38 24
6 53
120 48
8 72
55 32
22 78
78 200 <- Destination
```
**Output**
```
The shortest distance is 185.11044
The shortest path is: (4.0,62.0)-->(6.0,53.0)-->(38.0,24.0)-->(120.0,48.0)-->(125.0,95.0)
Number of weightings: 4
```
